# convert between the traditional Kazakh nomad calendar and Julian Days
# The Kazakh nomad calendar is unique in that its months are sidereal; the year begins when the new month co√Øncides with the new moon
# 254 sidereal months is very close to 19 years, a fact which I use in computing the year number
# In this version, days start at midnight
